# Blockchain-Powered Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)

## Project Description
This project leverages blockchain technology to power Alternate Reality Games (ARGs). The smart contract serves as the core game logic, enabling players to register, complete challenges, earn points, and claim rewards. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures fair play, while the reward pool incentivizes active participation.
